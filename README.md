This website has been created as a beginner-level project. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend and for backend, we use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
This site contains a ContactUs page on which there is a form for contacting the developer and giving feedback. The form data will be stored in the MongoDB database.
